  # Publish data on your website guidance
  Your data must be on a URL the public can access. We collect the latest data from there every day.

  You must link to that URL from a webpage about the data. This needs to be on your official planning authority website, usually ending in gov.uk.

  # Why publish on your website
  Your planning authority will always be the source of truth about your data.

  # Create your webpage
  The webpage must include:
    - the link to the data URL
    - a summary of what the data is about
    - a statement that the data is provided under the Open Government Licence
  
  ----------------------

  # Example webpage
