## Guidance

# Article 4 direction area
This dataset is about the geometry that each article 4 direction refers to.

The dataset must contain at least one entry (row) for each article 4 direction area.

It must containing the following fields (columns):

# reference
A reference or ID for each article 4 direction area that is:

- unique within your dataset
- permanent - it doesn’t change when the dataset is updated
If you don’t use a reference already, you will need to create one. This can be a short set of letters or numbers.

Example: A4Da1

# name
The official name of the article 4 direction. Example: Old Market

# geometry
The boundary for the article 4 direction area as a single polygon or multipolygon value. All points in the polygon must be in the WGS84 coordinate reference system.

If you’re providing geometry in a CSV, geometry should be in well-known text (WKT).

Example: MULTIPOLYGON (((1.188829 51.23478,1.188376 51.234909,1.188381 51.234917,1.187912 51.235022...

If you’re providing geometry in a GeoJSON, GML or Geopackage, use the associated geometry format.

# uprn
If the geometry is the boundary of a building, you can provide the Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN). Find the UPRN on GeoPlace.

If you provide the UPRN, you must also provide the address text.

# address-text
If the geometry is the boundary of a building, you can provide the address of the article 4 direction, written as text.

If you provide the address text, you must also provide the UPRN.

Example: 100 High Street, Bath

# article-4-direction
The reference for the article 4 direction used in the article 4 direction dataset.

Example: A4D1

# permitted-development-rights
A list of the permitted development rights withdrawn by the article 4 direction.

Separate the rights in the list using semicolons.

Only use rights from our permitted development right dataset. If the area withdraws a permitted development right that is not in our dataset, email digitalland@levellingup.gov.uk.

Example: 3D;3M;11B

# notes
Optional text on how this data was made or produced, or how it can be interpreted.

# start-date
The date that the article 4 direction came into force, written in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Example: 1984-03-28

# end-date
If applicable, the date that the article 4 direction was no longer in effect, written in YYYY-MM-DD format. If this does not apply, leave the cell blank.

Example: 1999-01-20

# entry-date
The date the entity was last updated.

If the entity has never been updated, enter the same date as start-date.

Write in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Example: 2022-12-20
